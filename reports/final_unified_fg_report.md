# Executive Summary

This synthesis of two focus group sessions, segmented by age (21–40 and 40+), reveals a consistent pattern of cautious curiosity toward white strawberries. Participants across both cohorts expressed intrigue about the novelty and unique flavor profile—often described as a pineapple-strawberry hybrid—but also voiced concerns about ripeness, naturalness, and nutritional value. Exposure to marketing campaigns notably increased interest, with "Nature’s White Wonder" and "Sweet Purity" emerging as clear favorites for their inclusive, sensory-rich, and accessible messaging. On average, interest scores increased by approximately 1 to 2 points on a 10-point scale post-campaign exposure.

These findings matter because they highlight the critical balance between appealing to consumers’ desire for novelty and addressing skepticism rooted in unfamiliarity and price sensitivity. Messaging that avoids elitist or luxury connotations while emphasizing natural purity, clear flavor descriptions, and transparency about ripeness and health benefits resonates strongly. Packaging that showcases the berries visually and includes educational elements can further reduce barriers.

Next steps include prioritizing the launch of the "Nature’s White Wonder" and "Sweet Purity" campaigns, focusing creative efforts on clear, inviting flavor and origin storytelling, and developing packaging with transparent windows and social media integration. Further research should explore older cohorts and test packaging prototypes to refine messaging and price positioning.

# Method & Sources

This report synthesizes findings from two individual focus group sessions conducted in San Francisco, each lasting approximately 60 minutes. The first session involved 12 participants aged 21–40, and the second included 12 participants aged 40 and over. Both groups evaluated five marketing campaigns: Pure Indulgence, Snowberry Bliss, Nature’s White Wonder, A Berry Like No Other, and Sweet Purity. The synthesis triangulates themes across these age segments, integrates verbatim quotes with precise attribution, and quantifies pre- and post-exposure interest shifts, favorite-concept votes, and willingness to pay (WTP) premiums relative to red strawberries.

# Participant Profile (Roll-Up)

Participants across both groups represented diverse professions including product design, data science, marketing, engineering, culinary arts, and more. The 21–40 cohort showed openness to food experimentation and social media engagement, while the 40+ group demonstrated cautious attitudes prioritizing taste, naturalness, and price. Both cohorts varied in favorite fruits and beverages, reflecting broad lifestyle and taste preferences. This diversity supports the generalizability of findings within urban, health-conscious consumer segments.

# Key Findings by Guide Question (Q1–Q7)

**Q1: What are your initial reactions to white strawberries?**

Participants across both age segments expressed a mix of curiosity and skepticism upon first encountering white strawberries. The white color often triggered associations with unripe fruit, leading to concerns about ripeness and naturalness. Many participants had heard of "pineberries" and found the pineapple-strawberry flavor description intriguing, which helped ease doubts. However, some questioned whether white strawberries were genetically modified or lacked nutritional benefits.

"My initial reaction was excitement... I did wonder whether white strawberries are actually ripe because... I equate ripeness with that deep red color." — Mia, FG1, 21–40, 00:07:06

"My immediate reaction is confusion. Strawberries have always been red to me, so a white one sounds like it’s not fully ripe." — Harold, FG2, 40+, 00:08:10

"The first thing that comes to mind is ‘are they natural?’... I learned they’re a hybrid... so they’re naturally white." — Tyler, FG1, 21–40, 00:07:49

"White strawberries initially make me think of underripe berries, so my instinct is that they would be hard and sour." — Linda, FG2, 40+, 00:08:55

"My first thought was like everyone else’s: are they unripe? But I’m also the type who loves novelty." — Jordan, FG1, 21–40, 00:09:04

Supporting Elements:

**Q2: How interested are you in purchasing white strawberries (1–10), and why?**

Initial interest was moderate in both groups, averaging around 7.5 in the younger cohort and lower (mostly 2–5) in the older cohort. Interest was driven by curiosity, novelty, and potential flavor uniqueness but moderated by concerns about price, availability, and nutritional value. Exposure to marketing campaigns increased interest by approximately 1–2 points on average in both groups.

"I’d rate my interest at an eight... I’m always looking for new ingredients to surprise diners." — Julian, FG1, 21–40, 00:13:34

Participants generally expressed willingness to pay a modest premium for white strawberries, typically ranging from 10% to 40%. Premiums were justified by novelty, flavor uniqueness, and special occasions. Price sensitivity was high, with many unwilling to pay luxury prices regularly. Nutritional equivalence and proven health benefits increased willingness to pay.

| Segment | Premium Range | Conditions Influencing WTP |

| 40+     | 0%–30%        | Special occasions, flavor superiority, health benefits |

# Cross-Question & Cross-Segment Synthesis

Across both age segments, skepticism about white strawberries’ naturalness and ripeness was a dominant theme, tempered by curiosity about flavor and novelty. Participants valued honest, clear messaging that addressed taste, ripeness, and production methods. Luxury or elitist language consistently reduced appeal, while inclusive and straightforward tones increased interest.

Price sensitivity was a common thread, with willingness to pay premiums linked to perceived flavor benefits or special occasions. Packaging and messaging that educate and visually reassure consumers are critical to overcoming barriers. Social media and visual appeal were stronger motivators among the younger cohort.

No significant differences emerged within the 40+ segment, but comparisons to the younger cohort suggest older consumers prioritize practicality and transparency more.
