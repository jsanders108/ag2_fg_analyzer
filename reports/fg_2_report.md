# Executive Summary

This focus group session with participants aged 40 and over revealed a cautious but curious attitude toward white strawberries. Initial reactions were dominated by skepticism, associating white strawberries with unripe fruit or novelty items, but interest generally increased after exposure to marketing campaigns that emphasized naturalness, taste, and accessibility. The campaigns "Sweet Purity" and "Nature’s White Wonder" resonated most strongly, shifting interest upward notably.

The findings highlight the importance of clear, honest messaging that addresses taste, ripeness, and natural origin while avoiding elitist or overly luxurious language. Packaging and marketing should emphasize transparency, flavor profiles, and visual appeal, with educational elements to overcome skepticism. Price sensitivity is high; most participants would only pay a modest premium under specific conditions such as special occasions or proven superior flavor.

Responses within the 40+ segment were notably uniform, with no significant differences in attitudes or preferences observed. This suggests messaging and campaign strategies can be broadly applied within this demographic without extensive segmentation.

# Study Context & Method

This report analyzes the second focus group session conducted in San Francisco, targeting adults aged 40 and over. The session lasted approximately 60 minutes and explored participants’ initial perceptions of white strawberries, their reactions to five distinct marketing campaign concepts, and their willingness to pay a premium compared to regular red strawberries. The analysis follows a structured approach aligned with the discussion guide questions (Q1–Q7), integrating verbatim quotes and segment-level insights to produce actionable recommendations for the White Strawberry launch.

# Participant Profile

The group consisted of 12 participants aged 43 to 64, representing diverse professions including marketing consulting, engineering, education, software management, bakery ownership, accounting, interior design, publishing, human resources, and construction. Participants resided in various San Francisco neighborhoods and surrounding areas. Their favorite fruits and beverages varied widely, reflecting a range of tastes and lifestyles. Notably, many participants expressed cautious attitudes toward new food products, valuing taste, naturalness, and price.

# Key Findings by Discussion-Guide Question

**Q1: What are your initial thoughts and associations when hearing "white strawberries"?**

Initial reactions were predominantly skeptical, with many associating white strawberries with unripe or bland fruit. Participants expressed confusion and concern about naturalness, with some fearing genetic modification or bleaching. For example, Harold said, "My immediate reaction is confusion. Strawberries have always been red to me, so a white one sounds like it’s not fully ripe." — **Harold, 40+, 00:08:10**. Linda echoed this, stating, "White strawberries initially make me think of underripe berries, so my instinct is that they would be hard and sour." — **Linda, 40+, 00:08:55**. However, some participants found the concept visually appealing or intriguing, like Elaine who noted, "To me, the idea is visually appealing. I’m drawn to unusual aesthetics." — **Elaine, 40+, 00:12:26**.

There was a tension between curiosity and skepticism, with concerns about taste, nutritional value, and price. Participants also questioned whether the white color indicated a lack of antioxidants or health benefits. The unfamiliarity of white strawberries in local markets contributed to wariness.

*Supporting Elements:*
- Multiple participants linked white color to unripe fruit or novelty (Samuel, Peter, Julio).
- Visual appeal noted but tempered by taste concerns (Elaine, Nancy).
- Skepticism about naturalness and production methods (Harold, Carmen).

**Q2: Have you encountered or tried white strawberries before? What was that experience?**

Most participants had no direct experience with white strawberries but had heard of "pineberries" or seen images online. Carmen shared, "I have not personally tried a white strawberry, but I heard about ‘pineberries’... The host described them as tasting like pineapple and strawberry combined." — **Carmen, 40+, 00:15:31**. Elaine recounted a positive tasting experience in Tokyo: "I actually tried something that might be similar... It was sweet and had a subtle pineapple note." — **Elaine, 40+, 00:17:36**. Nancy described sourcing white strawberries for a wedding cake, noting the high price and mixed guest reactions: "They tasted nice—sweet and a bit floral—but most guests asked if they were unripe." — **Nancy, 40+, 00:18:58**.

Others had only secondhand knowledge or internet research, reinforcing the perception of white strawberries as exotic and expensive. This lack of widespread availability contributed to limited firsthand experience and cautious attitudes.

*Supporting Elements:*
- Positive but rare tasting experiences (Elaine, Nancy).
- Awareness mainly through social media or secondhand stories (Linda, Samuel).
- Perception of white strawberries as luxury or novelty items (Peter, Victor).

**Q3: On a scale of 1–10, how interested are you in purchasing white strawberries initially, and why?**

Initial interest scores ranged mostly from 2 to 5, reflecting moderate curiosity tempered by skepticism. Peter rated his interest a 3, saying, "My curiosity bumps it up from a one, but my skepticism keeps it low." — **Peter, 40+, 00:22:14**. Elaine gave a 5, noting, "The designer in me is intrigued by the aesthetics... but the price tag and the question of whether they’re truly natural keep me from being more enthusiastic." — **Elaine, 40+, 00:22:56**. Samuel was less interested at 2, stating, "I’m not interested in novelty for novelty’s sake." — **Samuel, 40+, 00:23:40**.

Interest was often linked to price concerns, taste expectations, and perceived naturalness. Some participants expressed situational interest, such as for special occasions or as a treat.

*Supporting Elements:*
- Curiosity balanced by skepticism and price sensitivity (Harold, Linda).
- Interest influenced by perceived flavor and novelty (Carmen, Victor).
- Preference for local, seasonal fruit over novelty (Samuel).

**Q4: What are your impressions of each marketing campaign concept?**

Harold added, "It feels like something you’d see in an upscale magazine, not a grocery store." — **Harold, 40+, 00:29:48**. However, a few participants appreciated the elegant language, with Elaine noting, "From a design perspective, I like the sensory words like ‘delicate’ and ‘stunningly beautiful.’" — **Elaine, 40+, 00:31:41**.

*Snowberry Bliss* was more approachable, with Victor noting, "The name feels playful and less stuffy... ‘Perfectly ripe’ addresses my concern." — **Victor, 40+, 00:35:48**. Some participants still found the luxury language off-putting, but the sensory descriptors and reassurance about ripeness improved appeal.

*Nature’s White Wonder* was the favorite for many, praised for its inclusivity and focus on uniqueness without elitism. Elaine said, "I like this one because it talks about a ‘twist on the classic berry taste.’" — **Elaine, 40+, 00:42:07**. Samuel called it his favorite, appreciating the lack of luxury language. A minority noted it could be more explicit about flavor.

*A Berry Like No Other* was appreciated for sensory focus but criticized for negative phrasing. Samuel said, "I don’t like being told I settle for the ordinary." — **Samuel, 40+, 00:47:54**. Others found the rhetorical question pushy.

*Sweet Purity* was the top choice overall, described as straightforward and inviting. Julio said, "This is simple and to the point, which I like." — **Julio, 40+, 00:53:50**. Linda called it "approachable and honest." — **Linda, 40+, 00:54:23**.

The preference for these two campaigns was consistent across participants, reflecting a desire for honest, accessible messaging that highlights taste and uniqueness without elitism.

*Supporting Elements:*
- Top two campaigns accounted for majority votes.

Harold wanted packaging that states "naturally white when ripe" with a color chart. — **Harold, 40+, 01:08:32**. Victor suggested videos showing farmers picking and tasting the berries to make the product real. — **Victor, 40+, 01:09:10**.
