# Executive Summary

This focus group session with participants aged 21–40 in San Francisco revealed strong curiosity and cautious optimism about white strawberries. Initial interest ratings averaged around 7.5 out of 10, with many intrigued by the novelty and unique flavor profile described as a pineapple-strawberry hybrid. Exposure to marketing campaigns notably increased interest, especially for the "Nature’s White Wonder" and "Sweet Purity" concepts, which emphasized inclusivity, sensory appeal, and authenticity.

However, participants also expressed concerns about ripeness, nutritional value, and price, which moderated enthusiasm and could impact purchase decisions. Addressing these reservations upfront in messaging and packaging will be critical to converting curiosity into trial.

The findings highlight the importance of addressing concerns about ripeness, nutritional value, and price. Participants favored messaging that was inviting and clear about flavor and natural origin, avoiding elitist or luxury connotations. Packaging that is transparent, informative, and visually appealing was also emphasized.

Recommendations include prioritizing the "Nature’s White Wonder" and "Sweet Purity" campaigns for launch, focusing on messaging pillars of uniqueness, natural purity, and sensory delight. Creative efforts should incorporate clear flavor descriptions, reassurance about ripeness and health benefits, and social media-friendly visuals. Further research could explore older cohorts and test packaging prototypes.

# Study Context & Method

This study aimed to gather consumer insights on white strawberries and evaluate five distinct marketing campaigns. The session lasted approximately 60 minutes and involved 12 participants aged 21 to 40, all residents of San Francisco. The analysis focused on mapping participant feedback to seven discussion-guide questions, quantifying shifts in purchase interest pre- and post-campaign exposure, and assessing willingness to pay compared to regular red strawberries.

# Participant Profile

Participants were diverse in occupation and neighborhood, including product designers, data scientists, chefs, nutrition coaches, and social media managers. Favorite fruits and beverages varied widely, reflecting a group open to food experimentation and trend engagement. This cohort demonstrated a mix of adventurousness and health-consciousness, with many active on social media platforms.

# Key Findings by Discussion-Guide Question

Participants expressed curiosity and excitement about white strawberries, often associating the white color with novelty but also questioning ripeness. Many had heard of "pineberries" and were intrigued by the described pineapple-strawberry flavor. Concerns about whether the berries were natural or genetically modified were common. A minority expressed skepticism about the novelty or questioned the health benefits, which could dampen purchase intent.

**Pure Indulgence**

*Resonance & Differentiation:* This campaign’s lush, poetic language appealed to some for its sensory descriptions but was widely seen as elitist and potentially off-putting due to phrases like "statement of sophisticated taste." Participants felt it might alienate younger or budget-conscious consumers.

*Opportunities:* Tone down luxury language; focus more on flavor and natural purity. Clarify rarity reasons and avoid exclusivity cues.

*Indicative Quotes:* "The phrases ‘rare treasure’ and ‘statement of sophisticated taste’ make me think these are luxury items." — Tyler, 21–40, 00:19:27

**Snowberry Bliss**

*Resonance & Differentiation:* More accessible and playful, with clearer sensory cues like "crisp" and "refreshingly sweet." The phrase "perfectly ripe" addressed ripeness concerns. Some found "luxurious memory" slightly over the top.

*Opportunities:* Remove or soften "luxurious" language; add flavor notes like pineapple to spark curiosity.

*Opportunities:* Reframe opening to be more positive and inclusive; maintain sensory focus.

*Indicative Quotes:* "‘Why settle for the ordinary’ makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong by enjoying red strawberries." — Hannah, 21–40, 00:37:24
