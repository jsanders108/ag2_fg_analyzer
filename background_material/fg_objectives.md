## Background and Objectives

Our company has developed a unique new product: the White Strawberry. Unlike traditional red strawberries, this innovative fruit offers a visually distinct, white appearance, along with its own subtle, sweet flavor profile. As we prepare to introduce this exciting product to the market, we're seeking consumer insights to help determine the most effective marketing campaign. The objective of this research is to gather candid feedback through two separate focus groupsâ€”one consisting of younger adults aged 21 to 40, and another with adults aged over 40. Each focus group will last approximately 60 minutes. Insights gathered from these sessions will help us identify which marketing messages resonate best, potentially increasing consumer interest and willingness to purchase our new White Strawberries.
