# Final Synthesized FG Report — Task Instructions (White Strawberry Marketing Study)

## 1 ▪ Background & Purpose
Multiple **individual focus‑group (FG) reports** have been produced for the White Strawberry study. Your assignment is to **analyze across groups and consolidate** those reports into a single, **stakeholder‑ready final report** that:
- Triangulates **themes across all FGs** and across **age segments (21–40 vs 40+)**.
- Rolls up evaluation of the **five marketing campaigns** (*Pure Indulgence, Snowberry Bliss, Nature’s White Wonder, A Berry Like No Other, Sweet Purity*).
- Quantifies **pre‑ vs. post‑exposure interest shifts**, summarizes **favorite‑concept voting**, and assesses **willingness to pay (WTP) vs. red strawberries**, with segment‑level insights.
- Translates findings into **clear creative and go‑to‑market recommendations**.

---

## 2 ▪ Source Material
- **Individual FG Reports** — One per group, already structured by the discussion guide (Q1–Q7) with integrated quotes and timestamps.
- **Discussion Guide (Q1–Q7)** — Defines the question flow, including pre‑exposure interest and post‑campaign reactions.
- **Campaign Materials** — Exact names and assets tested: **Pure Indulgence**, **Snowberry Bliss**, **Nature’s White Wonder**, **A Berry Like No Other**, **Sweet Purity**.
- **Project Objectives** — Study goals, cohort definition (21–40; 40+), key measures (interest shift, favorite vote, WTP vs. red strawberries).

> **Assumption:** If any item above is missing for a given group, proceed using available evidence and note gaps explicitly in the final report.

## 3 ▪ Deliverable Overview
Produce **one polished Markdown document** that:
1) Synthesizes the discussions across **all groups** for each **guide question (Q1–Q7)**.  
2) Clearly contrasts **convergence vs. divergence** across groups **and** age segments.  
3) Integrates **verbatim quotations** with **(Participant, Group ID, Segment, HH:MM:SS)** attribution.  
4) Provides a **concept‑by‑concept roll‑up** for the five campaigns.  
5) Quantifies and summarizes **pre→post interest shifts**, **favorite‑concept votes**, and **WTP vs. red strawberries** (overall and by segment).  
6) Ends with prioritized **Implications & Recommendations** for messaging and creative next steps.

## 4 ▪ Detailed Requirements

### 4.1 ▪ Report Structure
| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Executive Summary** | 3 short paragraphs: **what we learned**, **why it matters**, **what to do next** (recommended campaign(s), message pillars, expected interest lift). |
| **Method & Sources** | List the source reports, number of groups, cohort split (21–40; 40+), session length (~60 min), and your approach to synthesis/triangulation. |
| **Participant Profile (Roll‑Up)** | Concise view of who attended across groups; only details that materially affect interpretation. |
| **Key Findings by Guide Question (Q1–Q7)** | Seven **mini‑syntheses** (template in §4.2), each crossing groups and segments. |
| **Concept‑by‑Concept Roll‑Up** | One subsection per campaign (template in §4.3). |
| **Pre vs. Post Interest & Favorite Vote** | Tables/concise text summarizing overall and by segments; include direction and magnitude of change where available. |
| **Willingness to Pay (vs. red strawberries)** | Summary of price expectations, premium thresholds, and **conditions** (occasions, quality cues, pack size) that unlock or suppress a premium. |
| **Cross‑Question & Cross‑Segment Synthesis** | Patterns that span questions and cohorts; tensions, trade‑offs, and decision rules. |
| **Implications & Recommendations** | **Messaging pillars**, creative **do/avoid** list, **next‑test ideas**, and research follow‑ups. |
| `# End of Report` | **Mandatory last line**—no content beyond this heading. |

### 4.2 ▪ Mini‑Synthesis Template for Each Question (Q1–Q7)
**Q[#: paraphrased question]**  
*Length:* ≥ 2 cohesive paragraphs.  
*Quotes:* **≥ 5 verbatim quotes** spanning **multiple groups** with **both age segments represented**; format quotes inline with: “quote.” — **[First Name], [Group ID], [21–40 or 40+], [HH:MM:SS]**  
*Evidence:* End with **≥ 3 bullet points** of concrete patterns, examples, tensions, or triggers.  
*Compare & Contrast:* Explicitly identify where groups **align or diverge** (and hypothesize why).  
*Minority Views:* Call out notable outliers and plausible reasons (knowledge, experience, context).

### 4.3 ▪ Concept‑by‑Concept Roll‑Up (for each campaign)
**[Campaign Name]**  
*Resonance & Differentiation:* What consistently worked/didn’t and why; any misinterpretations.  
*Drivers & Barriers:* Copy/visual elements that **increase** or **decrease** interest or intent to try.  
*Opportunities (Actionable):* Concrete **copy/visual** tweaks to test next.  
*Indicative Quotes (woven into prose):* Aim for **≥ 2** quotes with coverage across segments.  
*Segment Notes:* Any systematic **21–40 vs. 40+** differences (and implications).

### 4.4 ▪ Quant Summaries & Roll‑Up Rules
- **Pre → Post Interest (overall & by segment):**  
  - Where numeric scores exist, compute **direction and magnitude**: Δ = Post − Pre (report mean/median as available).  
  - Where only qualitative cues exist, label **↑ / ↓ / ↔** and **explain the rationale** drawn from quotes.  
  - If different groups used different scales, **normalize to 0–10** and note the assumption.
- **Favorite‑Concept Vote:**  
  - Provide **overall winner** and **segment‑level winners**; include **top‑2** concepts if separation is small.  
  - Note **reasons** behind choices; call out divergence by segment or group.
- **WTP vs. Red Strawberries:**  
  - Summarize whether participants will pay a **premium**, **parity**, or **discount**; quantify where available.  
  - Capture **conditions** that change WTP (e.g., novelty, provenance, pack size, seasonal/occasion framing, freshness cues).  
- **Data Integrity:**  
  - **Footnote gaps** (e.g., missing timestamps, unclear scales). Do **not** impute absent quotes.

### 4.5 ▪ Quote Handling
- Preserve **exact wording**; no paraphrasing within quotation marks.  
- Attribute **[First Name], [Group ID], [Segment], [HH:MM:SS]** immediately after each quote.  
- Maintain **chronological integrity** of timestamps as recorded in source transcripts.  
- Integrate quotes **within** analytical prose; **do not** list them in a block dump.

### 4.6 ▪ Style & Formatting
- Write in **concise, neutral business language**; avoid jargon and hedging.  
- Use Markdown headings and lists; **do not** use triple back‑ticks.  
- Use tables sparingly for **interest shifts**, **favorite votes**, and **WTP** summaries.  
- Spell‑check and ensure consistency in terminology (campaign names, segment labels).  
- End with the exact heading **“# End of Report”** and nothing after it.
