# Individual FG Report — Task Instructions (White Strawberry Marketing Study)

## 1. Objective
Create a **polished, stakeholder‑ready Markdown report** that turns the results of a focus‑group session into actionable insights for the **White Strawberry** launch. Specifically, evaluate five marketing campaigns, quantify shifts in purchase interest **pre‑ vs. post‑exposure**, assess **willingness to pay vs. red strawberries**, and highlight **differences between two cohorts (ages 21–40 and 40+)**.

## 2. What You Must Analyze

| Step | What to Do | Key Points to Remember |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| **2.1 Map to Discussion Guide** | Organize findings by **each discussion‑guide question (Q1–Q7)**. | Tie every theme explicitly to its question; surface motivations, barriers, and tensions. |
| **2.2 Pre/Post Interest** | Capture each participant’s **initial interest (1–10)** and how it **changed after campaign exposure**. | Compute/describe **direction and magnitude of change** at the group and segment (21–40 vs 40+) levels. Where exact scores aren’t stated, give a qualitative direction (↑ / ↓ / ↔) with rationale. |
| **2.3 Campaign Evaluation** | For **each campaign** — *Pure Indulgence, Snowberry Bliss, Nature’s White Wonder, A Berry Like No Other, Sweet Purity* — synthesize **likes/dislikes**, resonance, misinterpretations, and **suggested improvements**. | For Q4, integrate quotes as you compare campaigns; call out distinctive messaging/visuals and the **problem/benefit** they speak to. |
| **2.4 Favorite Vote** | Summarize the **vote for favorite concept** and the **reasons** behind choices. | Note **convergence vs. divergence** across segments; include the top 2 concepts overall and any segment‑specific winner. |
| **2.5 Messages & Visuals** | Distill **which messages and visuals** most increase interest or intent to try. | Translate into **actionable creative guidelines** (what to emphasize, avoid, test next). |
| **2.6 Willingness to Pay (WTP)** | Assess whether participants would pay **more than for red strawberries**, and by how much (if stated). | Capture **conditions** (e.g., occasions, quality cues, pack size) that unlock a premium; flag **price sensitivities**. |
| **2.7 Quote Integration** | Use **≥3 verbatim participant quotes** for **each** discussion‑guide question. | Quote **exact wording**—no paraphrasing. After each quote, include **[Speaker Name], [Segment], [hh:mm:ss]**. Weave quotes into the narrative; **do not** block‑list them. Aim to include at least **one quote per age segment** within those three. |
| **2.8 Depth & Balance** | For every question, craft **≥2 analytical paragraphs**. | Compare reinforcing vs. contradicting views; cite **≥3** concrete supporting elements (trends, examples, patterns). Call out minority opinions with plausible reasons. Maintain an **unbiased tone**. |

## 3. Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary** — 3 short paragraphs: **what we learned**, **why it matters**, **what to do next** (recommended campaign(s), key messages, segment differences, expected interest shift).
2. **Study Context & Method** — Purpose, the two cohorts (21–40; 40+), session length (~60 min), and analysis approach.
3. **Participant Profile** — Who attended and any noteworthy demographics relevant to interpretation.
4. **Key Findings by Discussion‑Guide Question** — Repeat the template below for **Q1–Q7**:  
   - *Heading:* “**Q[#: paraphrased question text]**”  
   - *Analysis:* ≥ 2 paragraphs interlaced with ≥ 3 verbatim quotes (with speaker, segment, timestamp).  
   - *Supporting Elements:* Bullet or inline mention of ≥ 3 specific observations/trends.  
5. **Concept‑by‑Concept Evaluation** — One subsection per campaign:  
   - *Heading:* “**[Campaign Name]**” (Pure Indulgence / Snowberry Bliss / Nature’s White Wonder / A Berry Like No Other / Sweet Purity)  
   - *Resonance & Differentiation:* What worked, what didn’t, and why.  
   - *Opportunities:* Concrete copy/visual tweaks to test next.  
6. **Favorite Vote & Rationale** — Tally and discuss **overall and by segment**; note rationale patterns.  
7. **Cross‑Question & Cross‑Segment Synthesis** — Patterns that span questions and age segments; implications for targeting and messaging.  
8. **Implications & Recommendations** — **Messaging pillars**, campaign shortlist, creative next steps, and any research follow‑ups.  
9. **Data Appendix (if available)** — Tables summarizing **pre vs. post interest**, **favorite‑vote counts**, and **WTP** (with any conditions).

> **Formatting Rules**  
> • Use standard Markdown headings and lists — **never** triple back‑ticks (```)  
> • Write in clear, non‑technical language suitable for mixed stakeholders.  
> • You may use **Markdown tables** for concise summaries.  
> • Finish the document with the exact heading **“# End of Report”** and add nothing after it.
